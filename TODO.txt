TODO LIST:

* When you 'edit_club', the guess_club_name jQuery function doesn't work.
* On the club add/edit form, there is a delete link, but this is not associated with a function. Ideally, it should delete the club membership without reloading the whole page (not delete the club!!)
* Privacy policy needs writing
* About us page needs writing
* "tell your friends" email function needs doing
* All marketing pages need writing
